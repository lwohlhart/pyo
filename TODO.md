This is a list of features/fixes to implement for future releases
=================================================================

Internal
--------

- Replace malloc/realloc with a custom memory pool allocator.

- Use inheritance (instead of a bunch of macros) at the C level. 
  PyoObject_base or Stream) should handle `mul`, `add` and 
  stream-related functions for every PyoObject. It should make the 
  code much simple and easier to maintain/extend, and also reduce 
  compiling time and binary size.


Server
------

- A method to retrieve a graph of the internal state of the server 
  (active objects, connections, attribute values, ...).

- Remove, if possible, PyGILState_Ensure/PyGILState_Release from 
  the process_buffers function.

Examples
--------

- A section about building fx and synth classes.


Objects
-------

- TrigMap(inputs, values, init=0, mul=1, add=0)

  Where `inputs` are a list of trigger objects and `values` (list of floats) 
  the corresponding values to output depending which trigger has been detected.
  A trigger from the second object will make the object output the second value
  from the list.

- Added random distribution in SfMarkerShuffler.

MIDI
----

- Create a MidiLinseg object that act like MidiAdsr but with a breakpoints
  function as the envelope. The sustain point should settable by the user.

- sysex support in MidiListener.


GUI
---

- Implement all GUI components with Tkinter and make it the default GUI
  toolkit (instead of wxpython). WxPython classes could be removed from
  pyo sources and built as an optional extra package (pyo-wxgui). The idea
  is to remove an extra dependency, as tk is generally builtin with python.

- MixerGUI, an interface to control the routing of a Mixer object.

- Keyboard, a virtual MIDI keyboard (adapted from Zyne's one).

- Save menu item in ctrl() and DataTable graph() windows.

- Ability to set channel "name" in the view of PyoGuiScope and PyoGuiSpectrum.

Tables
------

- Objects that can write to tables should accept any PyoTableObject,
  not just a NewTable or a DataTable.


E-Pyo
-----

- Window splitter to show more than one file at the time (multiple 
  views) ?

- We need A way to let the user interact with the script via input() 
  and raw_input() functions.
